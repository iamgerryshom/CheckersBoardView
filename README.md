### Programmatic Setup

```java
// Define players
final Player opponentPlayer = Player.computer(); // Built-in computer opponent
final Player humanPlayer = new Player("Human", "Human");

// Set up Checkers board
binding.checkersBoardView.setLocalPlayer(humanPlayer)
    .addMoveSequenceListener(moveSequence -> {
        // Triggered when a player's piece finishes its move sequence
        // 'moveSequence' contains a list of all the moves made
    })
    .addPlayerSwitchedListener(newActivePlayer -> {
        // Triggered after a player completes their turn and it's the opponent's turn
        binding.tvActivePlayer.setText(
            newActivePlayer.getId().equals(Player.computer().getId())
                ? "Computer's turn"
                : "Your turn"
        );
    })
    .addWinListener(winnerPlayer -> {
        // Triggered when either player cannot make any more valid moves
        binding.tvActivePlayer.setText(
            winnerPlayer.getId().equals(Player.computer().getId())
                ? "Computer Won"
                : "You Win"
        );
    })
    .addPieceCapturedListener((capturedPiecePlayerId, remainingPieceCount) -> {
        // Triggered whenever a piece is captured (single or chained)
        if (capturedPiecePlayerId.equals(Player.computer().getId())) {
            binding.tvOpponentPieceCount.setText("Computer: " + remainingPieceCount);
        } else {
            binding.tvMyPlayerPieceCount.setText("You: " + remainingPieceCount);
        }
    })
    // Choose one of the setup methods below:
    
    // For syncing the board state in multiplayer (online or LAN)
    //.setup(checkersBoard)

    // For local single-device play (e.g., against the computer or friend)
    .setup(humanPlayer.getId(), opponentPlayer);

```

### Rules

```java
// Define the rules for piece capturing
final CaptureRule captureRule = new CaptureRule(
    true,  // forceCapture: player must capture if able
    true,  // allowMultiCapture: allow multiple sequential jumps
    false  // mustTakeLongestJumpPath: not enforced
);

// Define the rules for overall game flow
final GameFlowRule gameFlowRule = new GameFlowRule(
    12, // maxTurnsWithoutCapture: max turns before draw
    60  // maxTurnDurationSeconds: max time per move in seconds
);

// Define the rules for King pieces
final KingPieceRule kingPieceRule = new KingPieceRule(
    0,     // maxMoveSteps (0 = unlimited)
    0,     // maxLandingStepsAfterCapture (0 = unlimited)
    false, // canChangeDirectionDuringMultiJump
    false  // canMoveImmediatelyAfterPromotion
);

// Define the rules for Normal pieces
final NormalPieceRule normalPieceRule = new NormalPieceRule(
    true,  // restrictToForwardMovement
    true,  // allowBackwardCapture
    true   // promoteOnlyAtLastRow
);

/*
 * If no rules are set explicitly, default rules will apply.
 */
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(captureRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(gameFlowRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(kingPieceRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(normalPieceRule);
```

---

### Playing Moves

```java
/**
 * In a remote player setup,
 * take the MoveSequence from the remote player and apply it.
 * This won't trigger your local moveSequence listener.
 */
binding.checkersBoardView.playOpponentMoveSequence(remotePlayerMoveSequence);
```
