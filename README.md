### Programmatic Setup

```java
// Set your player ID (must be unique between the two players)
binding.checkersBoardView.setMyPlayerId("me");

// Set up event listeners to respond to board events
binding.checkersBoardView.addListener(new CheckersBoardView.BoardListener() {
    @Override
    public void onWin(String winnerPlayerId) {
        // Called when a player wins the game
    }

    @Override
    public void onPieceCaptured(String capturedPiecePlayerId, int remainingPieceCount) {
        // Triggered when a piece is captured (jumped)
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivePlayerSwitched(String newActivePlayerId) {
        // Called when the active player changes after a move
    }

    @Override
    public void onPieceCompletedMoveSequence(MoveSequence moveSequence) {
        /*
         * Called when the player completes a move (regular move, single capture, or chain capture).
         * The full move sequence is provided and can be recorded or sent to an opponent.
         */
    }
});

/*
 * Initialize the shared game board.
 * Both players must reference the same CheckersBoard instance (use synchronization for remote play).
 */
binding.checkersBoardView.setCheckersBoard(new CheckersBoard());

/*
 * Use this method to play a move sequence received from the opponent.
 * Ideal for syncing moves in online or Bluetooth-based multiplayer games.
 */
binding.checkersBoardView.playOpponentMoveSequence(new MoveSequence());

// Define the rules for piece capturing
final CaptureRule captureRule = new CaptureRule(
        true, //forceCapture
        true, //allowMultiCapture
        false //mustTakeLongestJumpPath
);

// Define the rules for overall game flow
final GameFlowRule gameFlowRule = new GameFlowRule(
        12, //maxTurnsWithoutCapture
        60 //maxTurnDurationSeconds
);

// Define the rules for King pieces
final KingPieceRule kingPieceRule = new KingPieceRule(
        0, //maxMoveSteps (0 = infinity)
        0, //maxLandingStepsAfterCapture (0 == infinity)
        false, //canChangeDirectionDuringMultiJump
        false //canMoveImmediatelyAfterPromotion
);

// Define the rules for Normal pieces
final NormalPieceRule normalPieceRule = new NormalPieceRule(
        true, //restrictToForwardMovement
        true, //allowBackwardCapture
        true //promoteOnlyAtLastRow
);

/*
if you don't set any rules the default rules will be applied
 */
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(captureRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(gameFlowRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(kingPieceRule);
binding.checkersBoardView.setRule(normalPieceRule);
```
